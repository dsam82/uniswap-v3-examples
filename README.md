# Uniswap V3 Examples

This repository contains examples of Uniswap-V3 **core** contracts. Utilises periphery at multiple occassions to simplify calculations.

Also includes, my own notes on UniswapV3 code structure. Check out [NOTES.md](https://github.com/dsam82/scratch-space/blob/master/Notes.md)

To run the tests,

```bash
forge test -f <FORK_URL>
```
